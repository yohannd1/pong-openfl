# pong-openfl

A small game I'm (slowly) working on to get used to Haxe and Lime (and its
OpenFL-related capabilities). Expect very slow progress.

I was considering using Flash CS5.6 (I think that was the version I
tried out?) but I realized the mess it would become, since I was having
to use it from a VM.
